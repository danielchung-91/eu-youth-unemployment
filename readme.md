- [Unemployment, youth male (% of male labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.MA.ZS?view=chart)
- [Unemployment, youth total (% of total labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.UEM.1524.ZS?view=chart)
- [Government expenditure on education, total (% of government expenditure)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.XPD.TOTL.GB.ZS)

### Goal
Exploring the relationship between youth unemployment to key economic indicators.

### Introduction
Youth unemployment can have long term impacts on an economy associated to long term labour force productivity, drug use and crime (Görlich et al 2013). Thus it is important for economies to understand factors that increase and reduce youth unemployment to deploy appropriate policies for the sake of long term economic growth and sustainability.

This project will explore the relationship between education spending, capital flows, leisure time and youth unemployment in the EU (including Norway, Switzerland and the UK)

### Initial Processed Data Review
After the initial exporting of filtered CSVs from the dataframes, data was loaded into Tableau for visualisation. It was clear that large chunks of data prior to 1991 for certain countries were missing. Alternative datasets would need to be found to complete the data, otherwise the country would be culled.  

The data set would require data points prior to 1991 to be removed. Furthermore for a more indepth look into the topic the datasets would need to be appropriately prepared for timeseries analysis.
