# EU Youth Unemployment

Data Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator?tab=all)

- Unemployment, youth female (% of female labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate)
- Unemployment, youth male (% of male labor force ages 15-24) (modeled ILO estimate)
- 

### Goal
Exploring the relationship between youth unemployment to key economic indicators.

### Data culling
After exporting filtered CSVs of the dataframes, it was clear that certain countries were missing large chunks of data.  Alternative datasets would need to be found to complete the data, otherwise the country would be culled.
